# Vegeta-memcached [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/masahide/vegeta-memcached.png)](http://travis-ci.org/masahide/vegeta-memcached)

Vegeta is a versatile HTTP load testing tool built out of a need to drill
HTTP services with a constant request rate.
It can be used both as a command line utility and a library.

##### plot
Generates an HTML5 page with an interactive plot based on
[Dygraphs](http://dygraphs.com).
Click and drag to select a region to zoom into. Double click to zoom
out.
Input a different number on the bottom left corner input field
to change the moving average window size (in data points).

Each point on the plot shows a request, the X axis represents the time
at the start of the request and the Y axis represents the time taken
to complete that request.

##### hist
Computes and prints a text based histogram for the given buckets.
Each bucket upper bound is non-inclusive.
```
cat results.bin | vegeta report -reporter='hist[0,2ms,4ms,6ms]'

```

### dump
```
$ vegeta dump -h
Usage of vegeta dump:
  -dumper="": Dumper [json, csv]
  -inputs="stdin": Input files (comma separated)
  -output="stdout": Output file
```

#### -inputs
Specifies the input files containing attack results to be dumped. You can specify more than one (comma separated).

#### -output
Specifies the output file to which the dump will be written to.

#### -dumper
Specifies the dump format.

##### json
Dumps attack results as JSON objects.

##### csv
Dumps attack results as CSV records with six columns.
The columns are: unix timestamp in ns since epoch, http status code,
request latency in ns, bytes out, bytes in, and lastly the error.

## Usage: Distributed attacks
Whenever your load test can't be conducted due to Vegeta hitting machine limits
such as open files, memory, CPU or network bandwidth, it's a good idea to use Vegeta in a distributed manner.

In a hypothetical scenario where the desired attack rate is 60k requests per second,
let's assume we have 3 machines with `vegeta` installed.

Make sure open file descriptor and process limits are set to a high number for your user **on each machine**
using the `ulimit` command.

We're ready to start the attack. All we need to do is to divide the intended rate by the number of machines,
and use that number on each attack. Here we'll use [pdsh](https://code.google.com/p/pdsh/) for orchestration.

```shell
$ pdsh -b -w '10.0.1.1,10.0.2.1,10.0.3.1' \
    'echo "GET http://target/" | vegeta attack -rate=20000 -duration=60s > result.bin'
```

After the previous command finishes, we can gather the result files to use on our report.

```shell
$ for machine in "10.0.1.1 10.0.2.1 10.0.3.1"; do
    scp $machine:~/result.bin $machine.bin &
  done
```

The `report` command accepts multiple result files in a comma separated list.
It'll read and sort them by timestamp before generating reports.

```shell
$ vegeta report -inputs="10.0.1.1.bin,10.0.2.1.bin,10.0.3.1.bin"
Requests      [total, rate]         3600000, 60000.00
Latencies     [mean, 95, 99, max]   223.340085ms, 326.913687ms, 416.537743ms, 7.788103259s
Bytes In      [total, mean]         3714690, 3095.57
Bytes Out     [total, mean]         0, 0.00
Success       [ratio]               100.0%
Status Codes  [code:count]          200:3600000
Error Set:
```

## Usage (Library)
```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"

  vegeta "github.com/masahide/vegeta/lib"
)

func main() {
  rate := uint64(100) // per second
  duration := 4 * time.Second
  targeter := vegeta.NewStaticTargeter(vegeta.Target{
    Method: "GET",
    URL:    "http://localhost:9100/",
  })
  attacker := vegeta.NewAttacker()

  var metrics vegeta.Metrics
  for res := range attacker.Attack(targeter, rate, duration) {
    metrics.Add(res)
  }
  metrics.Close()

  fmt.Printf("99th percentile: %s\n", metrics.Latencies.P99)
}
```

#### Limitations
There will be an upper bound of the supported `rate` which varies on the
machine being used.
You could be CPU bound (unlikely), memory bound (more likely) or
have system resource limits being reached which ought to be tuned for
the process execution. The important limits for us are file descriptors
and processes. On a UNIX system you can get and set the current
soft-limit values for a user.
```shell
$ ulimit -n # file descriptors
2560
$ ulimit -u # processes / threads
709
```
Just pass a new number as the argument to change it.
